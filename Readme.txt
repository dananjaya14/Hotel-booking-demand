Hotel booking demand
Context
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests?

Hi! Welcome to the notebook!

This notebook will serve as the step by step code explanation on how I analyse the Hotel booking demand dataset. My goal is to predict whether the visitor will cancel or will stay in the hotels based on the number of aspects (columns) in the dataset. The decision made based on the result will be summarized using powerpoint presentation. Please do let me know if you have any suggestions for the methods I'm using in this notebook!
